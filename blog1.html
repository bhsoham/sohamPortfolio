        In the crypto world, security and authentication are of utmost
        importance. Most of us know about NFTs due to their trading values and
        ofcourse from celebrities showing them off. However, NFTs can have a
        wide range of other use cases. One such way in which NFTs can be used to
        revolutionize authentication is through soulbound tokens. <br><br><h3>But what are
            Soulbound NFTs?</h3> Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently
        <a style ="font-style: none; color: black"href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html">co-published a paper</a> explaining Soulbound tokens and their applications.
        The best approach to understanding the concept behind Soulbound NFTs is
        through video games. Even though most items in video games such as
        Valorant can be bought, most special items are obtained only by
        completing special tasks. For example, the Riot gun buddy is only
        awarded to those who leave a positive impression in the game and
        demonstrate good sportsmanship. These special items cannot be traded
        afterward and signify an accomplishment. As said earlier, NFTs often
        have an intrinsic social value and hence their price depends on their
        trading value. Crypto coins also have been historically in the news due
        to financial speculation. Thus the cooler NFTs often go to the highest
        bidder, hence becoming a symbol of wealth. NFTs that are obtained only
        through special activities or accomplishments are also often bought out
        and this is where Soulbound NFTs come into play. Soulbound NFTs can well
        represent a wave of new crypto applications to take Web3 to the next
        level. Soulbound tokens are non-transferable in addition to being
        non-fungible. This means that a particular Soulbound NFT cannot be
        traded or transferred and can belong only to a particular individual.
        They are thus harder to obtain than tradeable items and hold the ability
        to become the credentials of the future on the Web3. <br><br> <h3>Soulbound NFTs for
            authentication</h3>  Current authentication services on the web provided by
        companies such as Google or Facebook (Meta) use multi-factor
        authentication to authenticate users on their portal. However one can
        easily gain access to sensitive credentials to gain unauthorized access
        to sites. Soulbound tokens on the other hand solve this problem once and
        for all. They are a reflection of your identity and can be used as your
        digital KYC. A problem that can plague any authentication portal,
        especially those on the blockchain is the loss of credentials. While
        losing credentials on existing auth services by Google or Facebook can
        be solved just by clicking on the “Forgot password” link, getting back
        credentials of your soulbound NFTs can be a bit tricky. It involves a
        consenting community of soulbound NFT holders to come up and vouch for
        you. Applications of soulbound NFTs are endless. From digital resumes to
        university diplomas on the blockchain, soulbound NFTs can be used as an
        authentication tool almost everywhere. Government rights can be
        distributed only to the deserved and this would ensure true
        decentralization. Soulbound NFTs can also be used to streamline the
        process of lending on the blockchain and to maintain a credit score.
        However the most common applications these days include attendance in
        community meets (POAP — Proof of attendance protocol) and Proof of
        Humanity attestation.
